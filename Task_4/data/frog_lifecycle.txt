Title: Life Cycle of a Frog

The life cycle of a frog has four main stages: egg, tadpole, froglet, and adult frog.

Frogs begin as eggs laid in water. These eggs hatch into tadpoles, which live in water and have gills, a tail, and no legs.

As tadpoles grow, they develop legs and lungs. This stage is called the froglet stage.

Eventually, the tail disappears and the froglet becomes an adult frog, capable of living on land and reproducing.

This cycle helps frogs adapt to both aquatic and terrestrial environments.
