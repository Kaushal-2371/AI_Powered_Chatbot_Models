Title: The Water Cycle

The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, describes how water moves through Earth's atmosphere, surface, and underground. The main stages include evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.

Evaporation is when the sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, or oceans and turns it into vapor. This vapor rises into the atmosphere.

Condensation occurs when the vapor cools down and forms clouds.

Precipitation happens when water droplets in clouds become too heavy and fall back to the ground as rain, snow, or hail.

Finally, collection is when the fallen water gathers back in oceans, rivers, or underground, and the cycle continues.

The water cycle is crucial for maintaining life on Earth and supporting ecosystems by distributing fresh water across the planet.
